# Data Structures
Implemented various data structures in C++
## Stack
A stack is data structure that follows first-in first-out restrictions. This stack, STACK_HPP, is implemented with an array. The template allows for any data packages to be generated at compile time. The growth function resizes and copies.
## Graph
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.
## Tree
A Tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.
